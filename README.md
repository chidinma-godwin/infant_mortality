Bayesian Hierarchical modelling of infant mortality in Nigeria
## Overview
Infant mortality is an important index of the overall physical health of a country, it has received global attention with a resultant effect of drastic decline in infant mortality rate in some regions of the world. These achievements are challenged by differences that persist among countries. The under developed and disadvantaged populations still grapple with the burden of infant mortality. This research is aimed at examining the variables that are associated with infant mortality in Nigeria, the direction and magnitude of the effect, and determination of the geographical  variations (if it exists).
